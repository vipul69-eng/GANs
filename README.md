# GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) Repository

Welcome to the GANs Repository, a comprehensive collection of resources and implementations dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of Generative Adversarial Networks. This repository serves as a hub for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts who are interested in understanding and harnessing the power of GANs to generate realistic and novel data.

## What are GANs?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that enable the generation of synthetic data that closely resembles real data. GANs consist of two components: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator generates synthetic data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the real and synthetic data. Through an adversarial training process, the generator improves its ability to generate more convincing data, while the discriminator enhances its ability to differentiate between real and synthetic data.
